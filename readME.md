This mini project will cover the following:

~What is CORS and why do we use it?

-Is CORS more or less secure than custom headers?

~What is express static and why do we use it?

~How to connect the front-end to the back-end

We have set up a basic full stack application but we need you to complete the missing parts!

///////////////////////////////////////////////

Step 1 Checkout server.js and see what's missing....

Have we required everything we need?

Things we will be adding are CORS or Cross Origin Resources Sharing.

Wait!

Normally you would do an "npm install --save cors" but since we have graciously bestowed upon you a package.json all you should have to do is "NPM INSTALL" <-- You will use this often when working in teams.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Step 2 Now we need to stop giving away the mystery by showing the world all of our files...

Let's keep em interested but not give away too much with Express Static!

Since you npm installed then you should already have express static as a node_module but we still need to require it.

Once required we need to USE it (wink, wink)

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Step 3 Alright so now that we have those set up then we need to complete the server controls so we can actually get the data we need.

//////////////////////////////////////////

Step 4

Lastly, we need to connect the front-end to your node server and get that data!

Now since you know http.get and can use that from the controllers on the front-end it's your choice of whether to use an angular service or to just make the api call from your controllers
